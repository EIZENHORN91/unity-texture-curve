==========

Small helper used to bake [AnimatedCurve](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AnimationCurve.html) into [Texture2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Texture2D.html).
This is particularly usefull when you have a lot of objects to animate but doesn't want to have to update all of them to sample a Curve.
